-------------------[ Q & A ]-----------------------

Q: I have changed something. How do I compile the manual that I can see how it looks now?
A: When you do a first-time compile, you have to do a
   $ autoconf
   Now everytime you've changed something, do the following: 
   $ ./configure
   $ make
   which compiles the complete manual.
   The "make" creates by default the normal chunked html manual. If you want to have another
    output format, try the following targets:
    - bigmanual.html
    - html
    - phpweb
    - searchable_zip
    - searchable_tar
    - text
    - mirror-files
    - test

Q: I just want to compile one small file... how to stop compiling _all_?
A: Do a "./configure" and then "make test". This will compile the docs for the classes
    which were changed since the last "./configure" in the "testbuild/" directory

Q: For what is UTF8-dir?
A: All the xml files are converted to utf-8 when doing a ./configure and saved under the
    special "UTF8dir" directory. You have to redo a ./configure if you've changed something,
    because the manual is compiled from the "UTF8dir" folder

Q: For what is chapters.ent?
A: Seems to be a list with all chapters to compile....
    It is created when runnning ./configure from a the scripts/genchapterents.php.in

Q: How can I add my widget to the list of used widgets
A: The reference.xml in the main dir plays a role...
    Just add your class to this file

Q: How do I put an example into the manual?
A: See the files
   - en/tutorials/hellow.xml
   - en/reference/gdk/gdkwindow.xml at the function gdk.gdkwindow.method.set_cursor

Q: What is the difference between "<filename>" and "<filename>.in"?
A: The "<filename>.in" files are templates for the real files. The .in-files are converted
    to the normal files when doing a ./configure
