   This manual is split into two main parts.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   The first part is the <link linkend="userguide">Userguide</link>.  This
   discusses the general concepts behind creating a Graphical User Interface 
   (<acronym>GUI</acronym>) application.  The second part is the 
   <link linkend="reference">Reference</link> section.  This part of the
   manual details each of the GTK objects and the individual methods and
   signals that can be used with them.

  <title>About the Manual</title>
  <simpara>
   This manual is written using a modified version of the Docbook DTD.  The
   modifications that have been made allow the documentation of the object
   system used by PHP-GTK.  The XML basis for each of the classes and their
   methods is generated automagically from the PHP-GTK source code.  Note
   that it is not possible to generate signal information in this way, i.e.
   if there is no accompanying textual description then signal information
   is ispo facto incomplete for that class.
  </simpara>
  <para>
   The XML Generator was written by &link.andrei;, the original author of
   PHP-GTK itself.  The documentation is transformed from its XML source
   into various other formats using <acronym>XSL</acronym> as well as a host
   of other tools.
  </para>
  <para>
   The manual build system was created and is maintained by &link.jmoore;.
