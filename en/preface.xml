  This manual is split into three main parts.
 </simpara>
 <simpara>
  The first part is the <link linkend="userguide">Userguide</link>.  This
  discusses the general concepts behind creating a Graphical User Interface 
  (<acronym>GUI</acronym>) application.  The second part is the 
  <link linkend="reference">Reference</link> section.  This part of the
  manual details each of the GTK objects and the individual methods and
  signals that can be used with them.  Thirdly, there is a section named
  <link linkend="tutorials">Tutorials</link>.
 </simpara>
 <simpara>
  Only the Reference section is searchable (in PHP versions).

  The manual is produced using a modified version of the Docbook DTD.  The
  modifications that have been made allow the documentation of the object
  system used by PHP-GTK.  The XML basis for each of the classes and their
  methods is generated automagically from the PHP-GTK source code.  Note
  that it is not possible to generate signal information in this way, i.e.
  if there is no accompanying textual description then signal information
  is ispo facto incomplete for that class.

  The XML Generator was written by &link.andrei;, the original author of
  PHP-GTK itself.  The documentation is transformed from its XML source
  into various other formats using <acronym>XSL</acronym> stylesheets as
  well as a host of other tools.
 </simpara>
 <simpara>
  The manual build system was created by &link.jmoore; and is maintained
  by both himself and &link.steph;.
 </simpara>
 <simpara>
  The manual is currently available in plain text, single or multiple
  HTML, and searchable PHP formats, all of which are downloadable from
  the <ulink url="&url.phpgtk;">PHP-GTK website</ulink>.
