  <title>What are Widgets?</title>
  <simpara>
   <literal>widget</literal> is a term used in the world of X for any user
   interface.  A widget can be a text box, label, frame, window or any other
   GUI component.  GTK widgets are all derived from the abstract base class
   <classname>GtkWidget</classname>, and inherit the methods, signals and
   properties implemented therein.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   From a programming point of view a widget has five parts to its life cycle:
  </simpara>
  <para>
   <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>Creation</simpara>
     <simpara>
      In PHP-GTK this is done by creating an object, e.g. 
      <literal>$window = &amp;new GtkWindow();</literal>
     </simpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>Placement</simpara>
     <simpara>
      This is the step of adding a widget to a 
      <link linkend="containers.whatare">container</link>. This is
      achieved most straightforwardly in PHP-GTK by using the syntax 
      <literal>$container-&gt;add($widget);</literal>
     </simpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>Signal Connection</simpara>
     <simpara>
      This is the step of setting up callback functions for use. An example
      of this might be 
      <literal>
       $widget-&gt;connect(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;my_focus_func&quot;);
      </literal>,
      where &quot;event&quot; is a predefined state such as
      <signalname>clicked</signalname> and &quot;my_focus_func&quot; is the
      called subroutine.
     </simpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>Display</simpara>
     <simpara>
      This describes whether the widget is on display to the user.
      It is started by calling 
      <literal>$widget-&gt;show();</literal> and finished by
      <literal>$widget-&gt;hide();</literal>.
     </simpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>Destruction</simpara>
     <simpara>
      This occurs when the <function>gtk::main_quit()</function> function is
      called.  All actions that are necessary here are handled internally.
     </simpara>
    </listitem>
   </orderedlist>
  </para>
 </sect1>

 <sect1 id="containers.whatare">
  <title>What are Containers?</title>
  <simpara>
   A container is simply a <link linkend="widgets.whatare">widget</link>
   that is able to contain another widget.  The vast majority of widgets fall
   into this class; obvious examples include <classname>GtkWindow</classname>, 
   <classname>GtkTable</classname> and <classname>GtkBox</classname>.  Other
   than this property they are exactly the same as any other widget, and may
   be added to other containers as well as supporting child widgets of their
   own.  They are derived from the <classname>GtkContainer</classname> base
   class, which is itself derived from the <classname>GtkWidget</classname> 
   class.
