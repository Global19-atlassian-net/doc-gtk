  <title>What is PHP-GTK?</title>
  <simpara>
   PHP-GTK is a <ulink url="&url.php;">PHP</ulink> extension that enables
   you to write client-side, cross-platform GUI applications.  This is the
   first extension for <ulink url="&url.php;">PHP</ulink> of its kind, and
   was written in part to prove that <ulink url="&url.php;">PHP</ulink> is
   a capable general-purpose language that is suited to more than just the
   web application environment.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   This extension will <emphasis>not</emphasis> allow you to display GTK+ 
   applications in a web browser.  It is intended for creating standalone
   GUI applications.

    GTK+ was originally developed for <ulink url="&url.gimp;">GIMP</ulink>, 
    the <ulink url="&url.gnu;">GNU</ulink> Image Manipulation Program. 
    GTK+ stands for the GIMP Tool Kit.  GTK+ has grown from these
    beginnings and is now used as a central part of 
    <ulink url="&url.gnome;">Gnome</ulink>, the GNU Projects desktop
    environment.  GTK+ has also been ported to BeOS and Win32, making it
    the perfect choice to use as the basis for a PHP extension, keeping PHP
    as cross-platform as possible and allowing the creation of windowed
    applications in PHP for Linux, BeOS and Windows.

    GTK+ is a set of libraries written in C to create graphical user
    interfaces.  It has an object oriented architecture developed in 
    three libraries:

   <title>A History of PHP</title>
   <simpara>
    <ulink url="&url.php;">PHP</ulink> started life and is still
    primarily used as a server-side HTML-embedded scripting language.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    PHP, known originally as Personal Home Pages, was first
    conceived in the autumn of 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf.  He wrote it as a
    way to track visitors to his online CV.  The first version was released
    in early 1995, by which time Rasmus had found that by making the project
    open-source, people would fix his bugs.  The first version was very
    straightforward and had a simple parser which recognised a few special
    macros and provided some of the utilities which were in common usage on
    homepages back then.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    The parser was rewritten in mid-1995 and renamed PHP/FI version 2. 
    The "FI" in this version stood for the Form Interpreter which Rasmus
    had added to PHP to cope with the growing needs of webpages.  mSQL
    support was also added at this time.  PHP/FI underwent massive growth,
    and other people started to contribute code to it regularly.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    In mid-1997 Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans rewrote the main parser, and
    PHP shifted from being Rasmus' own to a more group orientated project. 
    This formed the basis for PHP3, now named PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor 
    - a recursive acronym.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    The latest version, PHP4, is another rewrite by Suraski and Gutmans and
    is based around the <ulink url="&url.zend;">Zend</ulink> engine.  PHP
    now has over two hundred regular contributors working on various parts
    of the project. It has a massive amount of third party extension
    modules, supports all popular servers natively, and has inbuilt MySql
    and ODBC support.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    The latest statistics show that PHP is now in use on over 5.5 million
    domains, and has had a steady usage growth rate over the past year. 
    It is far and away the single most popular Apache module; to give
    this some perspective, Apache currently holds nearly 60% of the
    market share of Internet webservers, whereas IIS servers (natively 
    supporting ASP) hold less than half that proportion of the market. 
    (Figures taken from <ulink url="&url.stats;">&url.stats;</ulink>
    March 2001.)

  <sect2 id="intro.whatis.php.whatdoes">
   <title>What does PHP do?</title>
   <simpara>
    PHP is a general purpose language. It is normally put to use as an
    html-embedded scripting language for use on the web, but it can also
    be used as a shell scripting language or even as a language to write
    windowed applications, in the form of PHP-GTK.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    Due to PHP's open-source nature, if there is something you can't
    currently do in PHP itself there is nothing stopping you from writing a
    PHP module or extension in C code to extend its functionality so that
    you can do what you want from within PHP itself. This is made possible
    through the well-documented API which is available to all.
   </simpara>

    PHP4 has two main parts to it:

  <simpara>
   The person I would like to thank most is James Henstridge
   <ulink url="mailto:&email.james.henstridge;">
    <email>&email.james.henstridge;</email></ulink>, the author of PyGTK 
   (Python GTK+ Bindings).  His help and advice have proved invaluable during
   the development of this extension, and a fair amount of the source code is
   based on or inspired by what he has developed for PyGTK.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   I would also like to thank the PHP Team for making such
   a great language, and the GTK+ Team for developing what
   has to be the best C-based GUI toolkit.
