   GTK+ was originally developed for <ulink url="&url.gimp;">GIMP</ulink>, 
   the <ulink url="&url.gnu;">GNU</ulink> Image Manipulation Program. 
   GTK+ stands for the GIMP Tool Kit.  GTK+ has grown from these
   beginnings and is now used as a central part of 
   <ulink url="&url.gnome;">Gnome</ulink>, the GNU Projects desktop
   environment.  GTK+ has also been ported to BeOS and Win32, making it

   as cross-platform as possible and allowing the creation of windowed
   applications in PHP for Linux, BeOS and Windows.
