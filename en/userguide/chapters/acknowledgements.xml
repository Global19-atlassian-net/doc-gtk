  The person I would like to thank most is &link.jhenstridge;, the author
  of PyGTK (Python GTK+ Bindings).  His help and advice have proved
  invaluable during the development of this extension, and a fair amount
  of the source code is based on or inspired by what he has developed
  for PyGTK.

  I would also like to thank the PHP Team for making such
  a great language, and the GTK+ Team for developing what
  has to be the best C-based GUI toolkit.
