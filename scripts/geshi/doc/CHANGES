at sourceforge (http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=114997&atid=670231)

Version 1.0.1
  -  Added methods set_symbols_style() and set_symbols_highlighting(). These should be used
     instead of set_brackets_style and set_brackets_highlighting respectively.
  -  Added a new field - language_path - that can be set either when the constructor is
     called, or by the new method set_language_path(), that specifies a path to the directory
     containing the language files (bug reported by bbspliff)
  -  Added a new method set_case_keywords(), that allows the auto-casing feature to be
     changed on the fly instead of simply being specified in the language file
  -  If there is an error the source that is outputted is now handled much better
  -  Lines are broken in the source only by \n now, not by \r\n (to save on output source)
  -  Indentation moved into its own method
  -  Method header() modified to allow the user to choose whether the code is surrounded in
     a <div> or a <pre> (see documentation for benefits of both). Method footer() likewise
     modified.
  -  Method get_stylesheet() modified so that a smaller comment is outputted in economy mode,
     and bugs with when line number classes are outputted in economy mode have been fixed
  -  Bug where spans had two quotes at the end of the attributes fixed (ie. <span style=".."">)

Version 1.0.0
  -  Initial Release
