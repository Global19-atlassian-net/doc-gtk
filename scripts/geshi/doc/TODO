       TODO - List of things to do as of 2004/08/05

- Add methods for adding/removing regexps for highlighting
- Better number highlighting!!!
- Better error handling/more error detection
- Setters for max/min tabs
- Better add/remove keyword groups methods
- More commenting for the engine part
- Let users specify custom header/footer for the outputted code
- Remove unnessecary $func var and calls to parse_non_string_part()
- Rename parse_non_string_part (?)
- Review setters' names and make shorter (?)
- Review the way attributes are inserted in parse_non_string_part
  so there's no possibility of conflict with inputted source code
- Create a wrapper class/include for easy use of CSS/easy highlighting
  with only one function call etc.
- More customisability for multiline comment styling
- Fix tabs so "tabs" are actually "tab stops" as in a normal editor

Waaay off in the future...

- Different output formats (XML, PDF etc)
- "Intelligent" highlighting inside comments (ie in some languages
  a comment is continue if the last character on the line is a \,
  and in some languages highlighting inside comments is a good idea
