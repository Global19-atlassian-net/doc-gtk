   <title>Introduction</title>
   <para>
    PHP-GTK 2 is an extension to PHP and can be used only with versions 5.1
    upwards. Although the most common way of installing PHP-GTK 2 is compiling,
    this process can prove to be quite tedious on Windows systems; in which
    case most people will be using the official PHP-GTK 2 Alpha binary release
    or the Gnope installer.
   </para>
   <para>
    We'll be covering the installation process for the three most popular
    operating systems: Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. The instructions for Linux
    are applicable to most distributions in addition to other POSIX compliant
    systems.

    <title>Using Gnope</title>
    <para>
     Gnope has proven to be the most easiest way of installing and maintaining
     PHP-GTK 2 on Windows. Gnope is a fully featured PHP-GTK 2 installer,
     complete with PHP 5.1 and PEAR. A few simple mouse clicks and you're done!
    </para>
    <para>
     Just download the installer from <ulink url="&url.gnope;">gnope.org</ulink>
     and follow the on-screen instructions. Gnope also has a PEARified channel
     of its own, where you can download PHP-GTK 2 applications, in addition to
     official PEAR packages from the Gtk2 category.
    </para>

    <title>Manual Installation</title>
    <para>
     Download the Alpha binary release of PHP-GTK 2 for Windows from the 
     PHP-GTK 2 <ulink url="&url.phpgtk.download;">download</ulink> page. Unzip
     the file into a directory of your choice. A directory named
     <literal>php-gtk</literal> will be created containing everything included
     in the release.
    </para>
    <para>
     You will need a copy of <literal>php.exe</literal> (CLI Version) and 
     <literal>php5ts.dll</literal>, both of which are available in the binary
     release of PHP 5 for windows, and put them in the
     <literal>php-gtk</literal> directory. If you wish to use any other
     extensions with this copy of <literal>php.exe</literal>, make sure you
     put their binaries here too.
    </para>
    <para>
     After this, you must set your <literal>PATH</literal> to include the
     <literal>gtk+2.6.9</literal> directory present in the release. You can
     also let the <literal>gtkpath</literal> batch file set the appropriate
     PATH for the current command line session by executing it.
    </para>

    <title>Compiling from CVS</title>
    <para>
     This is the least recommended method of installing PHP-GTK 2. If you still
     want to go ahead with this, please read win32/README.win32.txt in the CVS
     checkout.

   <title>Installation on Linux</title>
   
   <para>
    The best way to install PHP-GTK 2 on Linux is to compile it. No binary or
    source packages are available as yet for any distribution, so you can't use
    your favorite package manager to install PHP-GTK 2! These instructions
    should be valid for most distributions of Linux, as well as other POSIX
    compliant systems.
   </para>
   
   <note>The methods listed here reportedly don't work on FreeBSD</note>
   
   <para>
    There are two ways to go about installing PHP-GTK 2 on your Linux system.
    You can either choose to use your existing PHP installation, or decide to
    install a separate one and dedicate it to PHP-GTK 2. The latter is a simpler
    method and is recommended for users with little or no Linux experience.
    In any case, you need Gtk+ version 2.6 upwards installed.
   </para>
   
   <sect2>
    <title>Installing PHP-GTK 2 along with a new PHP installation</title>
    
    <para>
     Just follow these steps, and you should be okay! First thing you need 
     is a fresh checkout of PHP. You can choose either the 5_1 or 5_2 branches,
     both work fine:
     
     <programlisting role="bash">
         $ cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository login
         $ cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository co -r PHP_5_2 php-src
     </programlisting>
     
     Now, you need to compile and install it:
     
     <programlisting role="bash">
         $ cd php-src
         $ ./buildconf
         $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/php5_2 --disable-cgi
         $ make
         $ su
         $ make install
         $ echo extension=php_gtk2.so >> /opt/php5_2/lib/php.ini
         $ /opt/php5_2/bin/php-config --extension-dir | xargs echo 'extension_dir=' >> /opt/php5_2/lib/php.ini
     </programlisting>
    </para>
    
    <para>
     Now, let's checkout and install PHP-GTK 2:
     
      <programlisting role="bash">
         $ cd ..
         $ cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository co php-gtk
         $ cd php-gtk
         $ ./buildconf --with-phpize=/opt/php5_2/bin/phpize
         $ ./configure --with-php-config=/opt/php5_2/bin/php-config
         $ make
         $ make install
     </programlisting>
    </para>
    
    <para>
     You might want to create a link to the new php executable:
     
      <programlisting role="bash">
         $ ln -s /opt/php5_2/bin/php /usr/bin/php-gtk
      </programlisting>
      
     That's it, you're done!
    </para>
   
   </sect2>
   
   <sect2>
    <title>Using an existing PHP installation</title>
    
    <para>
     If you decide to `add-on' PHP-GTK 2 to your existing PHP installation,
     ensure that your version of PHP is atleast 5.1 with CLI enabled. PHP-GTK 2
     will NOT work with any other versions of PHP. You can check your PHP
     version by typing <command>php -v</command> on the command line. Don't
     forget to check if the word <literal>cli</literal> appears in the output!
    </para>
    
    <para>
     Now, checkout the latest CVS source of PHP-GTK 2, or download the Alpha
     source tarball, as per instructions on the PHP-GTK 2
     <ulink url="&url.phpgtk.download;">download</ulink> page.
     <literal>cd</literal> into the checked out / extracted directory, and
     execute the following:
     <programlisting role="bash">
         $ ./buildconf
         $ ./configure
         $ make
         $ make install
     </programlisting>
    </para>
    
    <para>
     This should just work for most people. However, if there are multiple
     installations of PHP in your machine or you have installed PHP in some
     exotic location, you might face trouble. Most of these cases can be solved
     by specifying the exact locations of the <literal>phpize</literal> and
     <literal>php-config</literal> files:
     <programlisting role="bash">
         $ ./buildconf --with-phpize=/path/to/phpize
         $ ./configure --with-php-config=/path/to/php-config
     </programlisting>
    </para>

   </sect2>
   
   <sect2>
    <title>Testing your installation</title>
    <para>
     You can test whether your installation was successful by executing:
     
     <programlisting role="bash">
         $ php-gtk -m | grep php-gtk
     </programlisting>
     
     You should get a single line that reads <literal>php-gtk</literal>.
     Substitute <literal>php-gtk</literal> with your PHP executable if you
     installed PHP-GTK 2 on your existing PHP installation.
    </para>
   </sect2>
      
  </sect1>
  
  <sect1 id="tutorials.installation.macosx">
  <title>Installation on Mac OS X</title>
  
    <para>
     You need to make sure you have the Apple Developer Tools, BSD Subsytem,
     and an installation of X before you try installing PHP-GTK 2. Although
     the BSD subsytem is installed by default on Mac OS X, you need select
     the Developer Tools and X Server manually. Although you can use any X
     server, the easiest would be to use the one Apple provides by default on
     it's Mac OS X installer.
    </para>
    
    <para>
     Get <ulink url="&url.macports;">MacPorts</ulink> (previously knows as
     DarwinPorts) or <ulink url="&url.fink;">Fink</ulink> and install it. You
     can use either to install a version of X (if you decided not to use
     Apple's default distribution), and Gtk+ itself. Both Fink and MacPorts
     provide versions 2.6 and above of Gtk+.
    </para>
    
    <para>
     Once you have all of the above in place, checkout a 5_2 branch of PHP,
     compile and install it. Although you may installation it anywhere,
     <literal>/usr/local</literal> is generally considered to be a good place.
     
     <programlisting role="bash">
         $ cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository co -r PHP_5_2 php-src
         $ cd php-src
         $ ./buildconf
         $ ./configure --disable-cgi
         $ make
         $ sudo make install
     </programlisting>
    </para>
    
    <para>
     Now get the latest checkout of PHP-GTK and compile it:
     
     <programlisting role="bash">
         $ cd..
         $ cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository co php-gtk
         $ cd php-gtk
         $ ./buildconf --with-phpize=/usr/local/bin/phpize
         $ ./configure --with-php-config=/usr/local/bin/php-config \
                       --disable-libglade
         $ make
         $ sudo make install
     </programlisting>
    </para>
    
    <para>
     Finally, copy over the <literal>php.ini-recommended</literal> file
     to <literal>/usr/local/lib/php.ini</literal> and change the value of
     <literal>extension_dir</literal> to the directory where
     <literal>php_gtk2.so</literal> resides. This is usually something like:
     <literal>/usr/local/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-some-date</literal>.
     You may want to create a new symbolic link in <literal>/usr/bin</literal>
     that points to <literal>/usr/local/bin/php</literal>
    </para>
